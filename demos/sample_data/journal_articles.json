A novel series of linear tripeptide inhibitors that are very potent and selective against the NS3 protease are described. A substantial contribution to the potency of these linear inhibitors arises from the introduction of a C8 substituent on the B-ring of the quinoline moiety found on the P2 of these inhibitors. The introduction of a C8 methyl group results not only in a modest increase in the cell-based potency of these inhibitors but more importantly in a much better pharmacokinetic profile in rats as well. Exploration of C8-substitutions led to the identification of the bromo derivative as the best group at this position, resulting in a significant increase in the cell-based potency of this class of inhibitors. Structure-activity studies on the C8-bromo derivatives ultimately led to the discovery of clinical candidate 29 (BI 201335), a very potent and selective inhibitor of genotype1 NS3 protease with a promising PK profile in rats.",

Anesthetic potency was similar to etomidate's, but stereoselectivity was reversed and attenuated. Relative to etomidate, TFD-etomidate was a more potent inhibitor of the excitatory receptors, nAChR (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) ((alpha1)(2)beta1delta1gamma1) and 5-HT(3A)R (serotonin type 3A receptor), causing significant inhibition at anesthetic concentrations. S- but not R-TFD-etomidate enhanced currents elicited from inhibitory alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A)Rs by low concentrations of GABA, but with a lower efficacy than R-etomidate, and site-directed mutagenesis suggests they act at different sites. [(3)H]TFD-etomidate photolabeled the alpha-subunit of the nAChR in a manner allosterically regulated by agonists and noncompetitive inhibitors. TFD-etomidate's novel pharmacology is unlike that of etomidate derivatives with photoactivable groups in the ester position, which behave like etomidate, suggesting that it will further enhance our understanding of anesthetic mechanisms.",

Because improved medicines are needed urgently, rational approaches were used to identify novel lead compounds effective against Toxoplasma gondii enoyl reductase (TgENR), a type II fatty acid synthase enzyme essential in parasites but not present in animals. Fifty-three compounds, including three classes that inhibit ENRs, were tested. Six compounds have antiparasite MIC(90)s < or = 6 microM without toxicity to host cells, three compounds have IC(90)s < 45 nM against recombinant TgENR, and two protect mice. To further understand the mode of inhibition, the cocrystal structure of one of the most promising candidate compounds in complex with TgENR has been determined to 2.7 A. The crystal structure reveals that the aliphatic side chain of compound 19 occupies, as predicted, space made available by replacement of a bulky hydrophobic residue in homologous bacterial ENRs by Ala in TgENR. This provides a paradigm, conceptual foundation, reagents, and lead compounds for future rational development and discovery of improved inhibitors of T. gondii.",

In many instances, they are currently used in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors in order to enhance their efficiency. Not surprisingly and as part of their mode of action, these drugs interfere with gene expression, a process that has long been known to be mediated by histone acetylation. In this paper, we use analytical ultracentrifuge analysis, equilibrium dialysis, and circular dichroism to characterize the role of histone acetylation on the binding of antharcyclines to chromatin. We show that histone acetylation enhances the daunomycin-induced DNA dissociation from nucleosomes and decreases the extent of aggregation that results from the interaction in a way that is modulated by the presence or absence of linker histones. Histone acetylation increases the binding affinity of daunomycin by chromatin. Furthermore, the binding of anthracycline to acetylated chromatin sheds additional light into the conformational chromatin alterations resulting from core histone acetylation.",

We analyzed enzyme properties of the D197 and E197 NAs and compared these to a D197N NA, known to arise after oseltamivir treatment. Zanamivir and peramivir bound slowly to the wild type NA, but binding of oseltamivir was more rapid. The D197E/N mutations resulted in faster binding of all three inhibitors. Analysis of the crystal structures of D197 and E197 NAs with and without inhibitors showed that the D197E mutation compromised the interaction of neighboring R150 with the N-acetyl group, common to the substrate sialic acid and all NA inhibitors. Although rotation of the E275 in the NA active site occurs upon binding peramivir in both the D197 and E197 NAs, this does not occur upon binding oseltamivir in the E197 NA. Lack of the E275 rotation would also account for the loss of slow binding and the partial resistance of influenza B wild type NAs to oseltamivir.",

In addition, the molecular dynamics simulations performed for VAP-1 reveal that the movements of Met211, Ser496, and especially Leu469 can enlarge the ligand-binding pocket, allowing larger ligands than those seen in the crystal structures to bind. Combining the data from molecular dynamics simulations, docking, and in vitro measurements, the three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) models for VAP-1 (q(2)(LOO): 0.636; r(2): 0.828) and MAOs (q(2)(LOO): 0.749, r(2): 0.840) were built and employed in the development of selective VAP-1 inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Radiolabeled nitroimidazole (NI) derivatives have been used for imaging hypoxic tissues. We synthesized NI derivatives conjugated with bifunctional chelating agents such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) and isothiocyanatobenzyl-NOTA (SCN-NOTA) via ethyleneamine bridge by formation of amide and thiourea bond, respectively. We proved that amide oxygen of Ga-NOTA-NI contributes to the formation of metal complex by X-ray crystallography. We labeled them with (68)Ga and found that both (68)Ga-NOTA-NI and (68)Ga- SCN-NOTA-NI were labeled in high efficiency (>96%) and were stable at room temperature in the prepared medium and at 37 degrees C in human serum. In vitro cell uptake experiments using CHO and CT-26 cell lines showed significantly increased uptakes of both of the agents in hypoxic condition. Biodistribution study in CT-26 xenografted mice showed increasing tumor to muscle ratios. (68)Ga-NOTA-NI showed lower intestine uptake than (68)Ga-NOTA-SCN-NI due to hydrophilicity. Also, (68)Ga-NOTA-NI showed higher tumor uptake than (68)Ga-NOTA-SCN-NI in an animal PET study. In conclusion, we successfully developed (68)Ga labeled NI derivatives for hypoxic tissue imaging.",

These hybrid compounds were expected to interact concurrently with the histamine-binding site and a putative hydrophobic region in the H3 receptor. Among them, piperidine- and pyridine-type derivatives displayed partial agonist activity, and (S)-4-(1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenylthio)ethyl)piperidine (36) was identified as a potent H3 agonist. We performed computational docking studies to examine the binding mode of the agonists. The results indicated that immepip interacts with the key residues, Asp114 and Glu206, in a different manner from histamine. The binding mode of 36 to these residues is similar to that of immepip, and the lipophilic tail of 36 has an additional interaction with a hydrophobic region in transmembrane helix 6 of the receptor. These results indicated that 36 served as a useful tool for studies on receptor-agonist interactions and drug design.",

VDAs are believed to be more efficient, less toxic, and several of them are currently undergoing clinical trials. To identify novel tubulin inhibitors that possess potent cytotoxicity and strong inhibition of tubulin polymerization as well as potent in vivo antitumor efficacy, we have utilized benzophenone scaffold. Complete SAR analysis of newly synthesized analogues that were prepared by incorporation of small heterocycles (C2, C4, and C5 position) into B-ring along with the evaluation of their in vitro cytotoxicity, tubulin polymerization inhibition, and in vivo antitumor activity allowed us to identify 22 (S516). Compound 22 was found to have potent cytotoxicity against several cancer cells including P-gp overexpressing MDR positive cell line (HCT15). It also induced cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase, which is associated with strong inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Its in vivo efficacy was improved by preparing its (l)-valine prodrug, 65 (CKD-516), which together with greatly improved aqueous solubility has shown marked antitumor efficacy against both murine tumors (CT26 and 3LL) and human xenogratfs (HCT116 and HCT15) in mice.",

However, its rapid degradation by enzymes like dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 24.11 severely compromises its effective clinical use. Whereas specific DPP-IV inhibitors have been developed, NEP 24.11 targets multiple sites in the GLP-1 sequence, which makes it difficult to block. To address this drawback, we have designed and synthesized conformationally constrained GLP-1 analogues by introducing multiple lactam bridges that stabilized both alpha-helices in the N- and C-terminal regions simultaneously. In addition to improving the receptor activation capability (up to 5-fold) by fixing the alpha-helical conformations required for optimal receptor interaction, the introduced lactam bridges provided outstanding shielding over NEP 24.11 (half-life of >96 h). These highly constrained peptides are the first examples of NEP 24.11-resistant GLP-1 analogues.",

A high-throughput screening effort identified pyridinyl-pyrimidine 6a as a moderately potent dual inhibitor of aurora kinases -A and -B. Optimization of this hit resulted in an anthranilamide lead (6j) that possessed improved enzyme and cellular activity and exhibited a high level of kinase selectivity. However, this anthranilamide and subsequent analogues suffered from a lack of oral bioavailability. Converting the internally hydrogen-bonded six-membered pseudo-ring of the anthranilamide to a phthalazine (8a-b) led to a dramatic improvement in oral bioavailability (38-61%F) while maintaining the potency and selectivity characteristics of the anthranilamide series. In a COLO 205 tumor pharmacodynamic assay measuring phosphorylation of the aurora-B substrate histone H3 at serine 10 (p-histone H3), oral administration of 8b at 50 mg/kg demonstrated significant reduction in tumor p-histone H3 for at least 6 h.",

Antimycobacterial activities of several 5-alkyl, 5-alkynyl, furanopyrimidines and related 2'-deoxynucleosides were investigated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Compounds with 5-arylalkynyl substituents (23-26, 33, 35) displayed potent in vitro antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The in vivo activity of 5-(2-pyridylethynyl)-uracil (26) and its 2'-deoxycytidine analogue, 5-(2-pyridylethynyl)-2'-deoxycytidine (35), was assessed in BALB/c mice infected with M. tuberculosis (H37Ra). Both compounds 26 and 35 given at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 5 weeks showed promising in vivo efficacy in a mouse model, with the 2'-deoxycytidine derivative being more effective than the uracil analogue and a reference drug d-cycloserine. These data indicated that there is a significant potential in this class of compounds.",

Although the initial therapeutic attempts focused on HIV-coded enzymes, structural HIV proteins and, more specifically, the mechanisms that the virus uses to infect and replicate are now also considered therapeutic targets. The interest for viral fusion and entry inhibitors is growing significantly, given that they are applicable in combined therapies or when resistance to other antiretroviral drugs is seen and that they act before the virus enters the cell. The 124 synthetic sequences of the GBV-C E2 envelope protein have been obtained by SPPS. The interaction of certain GBV-C peptide sequences with the HIV-1 fusion peptide has been proven through the use of biophysical techniques. We also show how GBV-C E2 domains notably decrease cellular membrane fusion and interfere with the HIV-1 infectivity in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting their potential utility in future anti-HIV-1 therapies.",

Our goal was to identify a back up compound with equal potency, increased solubility, and increased exposure. We expanded our structure-activity studies in this series by branching at the alpha position of the C-2 benzyl side chain and through modification of substituents on the carboxylic A-ring of the quinoline. This resulted in discovery of PSI-421 with marked improvement in aqueous solubility and pharmacokinetic properties. This compound has shown oral efficacy in animal models of arterial and venous injury and was selected as a preclinical development compound for potential treatment of such diseases as atherosclerosis and deep vein thrombosis.",

The screening identified an aminopyrimidine with affinity in the high micromolar range and subsequent structure-based design allowed its optimization into a low nanomolar series with good ligand efficiency. A phenolic chemotype was also identified in fragment screening and was found to bind with affinity close to 1 mM. This fragment was optimized using structure based design into a resorcinol lead which has subnanomolar affinity for Hsp90, excellent cell potency, and good ligand efficiency. This fragment to lead campaign improved affinity for Hsp90 by over 1,000,000-fold with the addition of only six heavy atoms. The companion paper (DOI: 10.1021/jm100060b) describes how the resorcinol lead was optimized into a compound that is now in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.",

The structures were determined by analyses of spectral and X-ray data. Compound 1 induced convulsions upon intracerebroventricular injection into mice, with a CD50 value of 2.4 nmol/mouse. Purines 2-4 were active in mouse bioassays at higher doses. The seizurogenic activity of 1 was correlated with inhibition of neuronal GABAergic transmission, with only a modest impact on excitatory signaling, in electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons. Despite having a purine template structure, the inhibitory activity of 1 was not prevented by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Thus, 1 represents a novel substituted purine that elicits convulsions through its actions on inhibitory neurotransmission. These 8-oxoisoguanine analogs comprise a new family of compounds closely related in structure to endogenous neurosignaling molecules and commonly used CNS stimulants.",

In contrast, a hexacationic character in a strong, amphipathic helix (DeltaFd) confers potent and broad spectrum action [MICs E. coli 2.5 microM, S. aureus 5 microM]. While DeltaFd caused rapid and potent permeabilization of the E. coli membranes, the less helical intermediates (peptides A-D) showed slow and weak to no responses.

Through a sequential lead optimization process considering the different positions present in the initial scaffold, nanomolar and subnanomolar inhibitors at falcipains 2 and 3 were identified, with activity against cultured parasites in the micromolar range. Introduction of protonable amines within lead molecules led to marked improvements of up to 1000 times in activity against cultured parasites without noteworthy alterations in other SAR tendencies. Optimized compounds presented enzymatic activities in the picomolar to low nanomolar range and antiparasitic activities in the low nanomolar range.",

To further explore structure-activity relationships at the serotonin transporter (SERT), a series of (+/-)-4- and 5-substituted citalopram analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for binding at the SERT, dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) in native rodent tissue. Many of these analogues showed high SERT binding affinities (Ki=1-40 nM) and selectivities over both NET and DAT. Selected enantiomeric pairs of analogues were synthesized and both retained enantioselectivity as with S- and R-1, wherein S>R at the SERT. In addition, the enantiomeric pairs of 1 and 5 were tested for binding at the homologous bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), wherein low affinities and the absence of enantioselectivity suggested distinctive binding sites for these compounds at SERT as compared to LeuT. These novel ligands will provide molecular tools to elucidate drug-protein interactions at the SERT and to relate those to behavioral actions in vivo.",

Introduction of conformational restriction led to a novel series characterized by exquisite potency and favorable steroid receptor selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile.

When MCF-7 cells were treated with the analogues, those resulting from hydrogen substitution by isopropyl (3d), isobutyl (3f), cyclopentyl (3g), and pyrano- (2) inhibited cell proliferation, estrogen-induced transcriptional activity, and estrogen receptor (ER) regulated progesterone receptor (PgR) gene expression. However, methyl (3a) and ethyl (3b) substitutions of the hydroxyl proton only led to moderate reduction of the estrogenic activities. These results demonstrated the structural requirements for the transformation of daidzein from an ER agonist to an antagonist.

Of the several structurally distinct small molecule histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) reported, macrocyclic depsipeptides possess the most complex cap groups and have demonstrated excellent HDAC inhibition potency and isoform selectivity. Unfortunately, the development of macrocyclic depsipeptides has been hampered in part because of development problems characteristic of large peptides and the complex reaction schemes required for their synthesis. Herein we report that tricyclic ketolide TE-802 is an excellent mimetic for the peptide backbone of macrocyclic HDACi. Compounds derived from this template are particularly selective against HDACs 1 and 2 with nanomolar inhibitory activity. Interrogation of the association between a subset of these compounds and key HDAC isoforms, using AutoDock, enables a molecular description of the interaction between the HDAC enzyme's outer rim and the inhibitors' macrocyclic cap group that are responsible for compound affinity and presumably isoform selectivity.",

        "abstract": "Protein arginine methylation regulates multiple biological processes such as chromatin remodeling and RNA splicing. Malfunction of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) is correlated with many human diseases. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of protein arginine methylation are of great potential for therapeutic development. Herein, we report a type of compound that blocks PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation at micromolar potency through a unique mechanism. Most of the discovered compounds bear naphthalene and sulfonate groups and are structurally different from typical PRMT substrates, for example, histone H4 and glycine- and arginine-rich sequences. To elucidate the molecular basis of inhibition, we conducted a variety of kinetic and biophysical assays. The combined data reveal that this type of naphthyl-sulfo (NS) molecule directly targets the substrates but not PRMTs for the observed inhibition. We also found that suramin effectively inhibited PRMT1 activity. These findings about novel PRMT inhibitors and their unique inhibition mechanism provide a new way for chemical regulation of protein arginine methylation.",

However, this compound does not have trypanocidal activity due to its poor membrane permeability. Consequently, we have previously reported a prodrug approach to improve the antiparasitic activity of this inhibitor by converting the phosphate group into a less charged phosphate prodrug. The activity of prodrugs appeared to be dependent on their stability in phosphate buffer. Here we have successfully further extended the development of the aryl phosphoramidate prodrugs of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-4-erythrono hydroxamate by synthesizing a small library of phosphoramidates and evaluating their biological activity and stability in a variety of assays. Some of the compounds showed high trypanocidal activity and good correlation of activity with their stability in fresh mouse blood.",

Finally, the data set has been used in conjunction with the open source fpocket suite to train and validate a logistic model. State of the art performance was achieved for predicting druggability on known binding sites and on virtual screening experiments where druggable pockets are retrieved from a pool of decoys. The algorithm is free, extremely fast, and can effectively be used to automatically sieve through massive collections of structures ( http://fpocket.sourceforge.net ).",

In contrast, herpes virus thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK) readily activates ACV. We wanted to understand why human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which is related to HSV1-TK and phosphorylates deoxyguanosine, does not accept acyclic guanine analogues as substrates. Therefore, we crystallized dCK in complex with ACV at the nucleoside phosphoryl acceptor site and UDP at the phosphoryl donor site. The structure reveals that while ACV does bind at the dCK active site, it does so adopting a nonproductive conformation. Despite binding ACV, the enzyme remains in the open, inactive state. In comparison to ACV binding to HSV1-TK, in dCK, the nucleoside base adopts a different orientation related by about a 60 degrees rotation. Our analysis suggests that dCK would phosphorylate acyclic guanine analogues if they can induce a similar rotation.",

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that a 28-amino acid peptide derived from the BRC4 motif of BRCA2 tumor suppressor inhibits selectively human RAD51 recombinase (HsRad51). With the aim of designing better inhibitors for cancer treatment, we combined an in silico docking approach with in vitro biochemical testing to construct a highly efficient chimera peptide from eight existing human BRC motifs. We built a molecular model of all BRC motifs complexed with HsRad51 based on the crystal structure of the BRC4 motif-HsRad51 complex, computed the interaction energy of each residue in each BRC motif, and selected the best amino acid residue at each binding position. This analysis enabled us to propose four amino acid substitutions in the BRC4 motif. Three of these increased the inhibitory effect in vitro, and this effect was found to be additive. We thus obtained a peptide that is about 10 times more efficient in inhibiting HsRad51-ssDNA complex formation than the original peptide.",

Thus, blockade of androgen production in testes and adrenals by CYP17 inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of PC. Moreover, many PC patients suffer from glucocorticoid overproduction, and importantly mutated androgen receptors can be stimulated by glucocorticoids. In this study, the first dual inhibitor of CYP17 and CYP11B1 (the enzyme responsible for the last step in glucocorticoid biosynthesis) is described. A series of biphenylmethylene pyridines has been designed, synthesized, and tested as CYP17 and CYP11B1 inhibitors. The most active compounds were also tested for selectivity against CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), CYP19 (aromatase), and hepatic CYP3A4. In detail, compound 6 was identified as a dual inhibitor of CYP17/CYP11B1 (IC(50) values of 226 and 287 nM) showing little inhibition of the other enzymes as well as compound 9 as a selective, highly potent CYP17 inhibitor (IC(50) = 52 nM) exceeding abiraterone in terms of activity and selectivity.",

None of the tested analogues were substrates for human recombinant spermine oxidase, but those having free aminoterminus, including 1,8-diamino-3,6-diazaoctane (Trien, 3a), were acetylated by mouse recombinant spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase. 5a was acetylated to 5c and 5b, and the latter was further metabolized by acetylpolyamine oxidase to 3a, a drug used to treat Wilson's disease.

We have found that these types of fingerprints have at least limited scaffold hopping ability including early enrichment of small numbers of active scaffolds at high database ranks. However, it has not been possible to derive Tanimoto coefficient value ranges for individual fingerprints that are generally preferred for scaffold hopping. For selected fingerprints, similarity threshold values have been identified that yield small database selection sets having a high probability to contain a few active scaffolds. Furthermore, essentially all tested fingerprints have shown the ability to enrich scaffold hops in approximately 1% of a screening database. For the test cases reported herein, selecting 0.5-1% of the screening database yields approximately 25% of the available scaffolds. On the basis of our findings, practical guidelines for virtual screening using different types of 2D fingerprints have been formulated.",

Here we describe a scanning approach using a library of pyranose-based peptidomimetics that is structurally diverse in a systematic manner, designed to cover all possible conformations of tripeptide motifs containing two aromatic groups and one positive charge. Structural diversity was achieved by efficient selection of various chemoforms, characterized by a choice of pyranose scaffold of defined chirality and substitution pattern. A systematic scanning library of 490 compounds was thus designed, produced, and screened in vitro for activity at the somatostatin (sst(1-5)) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH(1)) receptors. Bioactive compounds were found for each target, with specific chemoform preferences identified in each case, which can be used to guide follow-on drug discovery projects without the need for scaffold hopping.",

A comparative three-dimensional model of the catalytic domain of matriptase-2 was generated and utilized for structure-based virtual screening in combination with similarity searching and knowledge-based compound design. Two N-protected dipeptide amides containing a 4-amidinobenzylamide as P1 residue (compounds 1 and 3) were identified as the first small molecule inhibitors of matriptase-2 with K(i) values of 170 and 460 nM, respectively.

To overcome these disadvantages, several novel derivatives of gossypol were designed, synthesized, and analyzed. One of the derivatives, compound 7 (6-aminopenicillanic acid sodium-gossypolone), was identified with great water solubility and anticancer property, suggested by inducing a dramatically decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expression level found in vitro and growth inhibition of murine colon tumor in vivo. Furthermore, it was also recognized with less toxicity than compound 1 in vivo and significantly increased chemotherapeutic sensitivity against colon cancer in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil. Therefore, it is concluded that compound 7 is superior to parent compound 1, and further preclinical studies of compound 7 is necessary for colon cancer therapy.",

Substituents at the 4-position of 3-phenylsulfonylfuroxan scaffold were able to modulate the selectivity and the intensity of inhibition. In some cases, they reverted MRP1 inhibitor activity, namely, they were capable of potentiating MRP1 dependent efflux. When compounds 16 and 17 were coadministered with doxorubicin, they restored a high degree of the activity of the antibiotic. Preliminary immunoblotting studies carried out on these two compounds indicate that they are capable of nitrating P-gp, which in this form is likely unable to efflux the antibiotic.",

Nine compounds showed more effective inhibitory activity than the hit compound 1 in ThT fluorescence assay.

The impact of trimethylation on the solution conformation of selected analogues has been evaluated by NMR, which indicates a slight decrease in the alpha-helical content of the modified peptides, particularly in the N-terminal region. Trimethylation also enhances the proteolytic stability of mono- and bis-trimethylated analogues by 2-3-fold. Although it tends to lower antimicrobial activity in absolute terms, trimethylation causes an even higher decrease in hemolytic activity and therefore results in improved selectivity for several analogues. The monotrimethylated analogue at position 6 shows the overall best selectivity against both the Leishmania donovani protozoan and Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative bacterium of increasing clinical concern.",

        "abstract": "Neuropathic pain states and tolerance to opioids can result from system changes in the CNS, such as up-regulation of the NK1 receptor and substance P, lead to antiopioid effects in ascending or descending pain-signaling pathways. Bifunctional compounds, possessing both the NK1 antagonist pharmacophore and the opioid agonist pharmacophore with delta-selectivity, could counteract these system changes to have significant analgesic efficacy without undesirable side effects. As a result of the introduction of cyclic and topological constraints with penicillamines, 2 (Tyr-cyclo[d-Pen-Gly-Phe-Pen]-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-[3',5'-(CF(3))(2)-Bzl]) was found as the best bifunctional compound with effective NK1 antagonist and potent opioid agonist activities, and 1400-fold delta-selectivity over the mu-receptor. The NMR structural analysis of 2 revealed that the relative positioning of the two connected pharmacophores as well as its cyclic and topological constraints might be responsible for its excellent bifunctional activities as well as its significant delta-opioid selectivity. Together with the observed high metabolic stability, 2 could be considered as a valuable research tool and possibly a promising candidate for a novel analgesic drug.",

Genetic knockdown of G9a inhibits cancer cell growth, and the dimethylation of p53 K373 results in the inactivation of p53. Initial SAR exploration of the 2,4-diamino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline template represented by 3a (BIX01294), a selective small molecule inhibitor of G9a and GLP, led to the discovery of 10 (UNC0224) as a potent G9a inhibitor with excellent selectivity. A high resolution X-ray crystal structure of the G9a-10 complex, the first cocrystal structure of G9a with a small molecule inhibitor, was obtained. On the basis of the structural insights revealed by this cocrystal structure, optimization of the 7-dimethylaminopropoxy side chain of 10 resulted in the discovery of 29 (UNC0321) (Morrison K(i) = 63 pM), which is the first G9a inhibitor with picomolar potency and the most potent G9a inhibitor to date.",

Placement of small nonpolar, nonbulky substituents at the 3-oxy site provided compounds with pronounced seizure protection in the maximal electroshock (MES) seizure test with activities similar to (R)-1. The anticonvulsant activity loss that accompanied introduction of larger moieties at the 3-oxy site in (R)-1 was offset, in part, by including unsaturated groups at this position. Our findings were similar to a recently reported SAR study of the 4'-benzylamide site in (R)-1 ( J. Med. Chem. 2010 , 53 , 1288 - 1305 ). Together, these results indicate that both the 3-oxy and 4'-benzylamide positions in (R)-1 can accommodate nonbulky, hydrophobic groups and still retain pronounced anticonvulsant activities in rodents in the MES seizure model.",

The necessary pharmacophore sets the peptides up for degradation by chymotrypsin, and a heavily truncated native tripeptide was rapidly digested despite its short sequence. Degradation studies indicated that increased half-lives could be obtained by altering the binding to each subsite surrounding the active site without sacrificing the antimicrobial activity. Important structural and mechanistic features were revealed in a fashion not feasible through the use of native peptide substrates. The results, which are generally applicable to a range of relevant peptides, further show that not only the S1 pocket, but also to the notably less studied S1' site can be used to control the proteolytic stability by incorporating different analogues of tryptophan and arginine.",

The X-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of VDR complexed with 2 indicated that this ligand induces an extra cavity within the ligand-binding pocket. The structure also showed that the ligand forms only poor hydrophobic interactions with helix 12 of the protein. Here, to study the effects of the induction of the extra cavity and of insufficient interactions with helix 12 on antagonism, we designed and synthesized a series of vitamin D(3) analogues with or without a 22-alkyl substituent and evaluated their biological potency. We found that the 22-butyl analogues 3c and 5c act as full antagonists, the 22-ethyl analogues 3b, 4b, 5b, and 22-butyl analogue 4c act as partial agonists, and the others (3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 6b, and 6c) act as full agonists for VDR. It is intriguing that 6c is a potent agonist for VDR, whereas its 26,27-dinor analogue 5c is a potent antagonist. Analogue 6c recruited coactivator SRC-1 well, but 5c did not. These results indicate that a combination of induction of the extra cavity and insufficient hydrophobic interactions with helix 12 is important for VDR antagonism in this class of ligands.",

Selective inhibition of NAAA by (S)-N-(2-oxo-3-oxetanyl)-3-phenylpropionamide [(S)-OOPP, 7a] prevents PEA degradation in mouse leukocytes and attenuates responses to proinflammatory stimuli. Starting from the structure of 7a, a series of beta-lactones was prepared and tested on recombinant rat NAAA to explore structure-activity relationships (SARs) for this class of inhibitors and improve their in vitro potency. Following the hypothesis that these compounds inhibit NAAA by acylation of the catalytic cysteine, we identified several requirements for recognition at the active site and obtained new potent inhibitors. In particular, (S)-N-(2-oxo-3-oxetanyl)biphenyl-4-carboxamide (7h) was more potent than 7a at inhibiting recombinant rat NAAA activity (7a, IC(50) = 420 nM; 7h, IC(50) = 115 nM) in vitro and at reducing carrageenan-induced leukocyte infiltration in vivo.",

Electrochemical studies demonstrated that the Cu complexes of these ligands had lower redox potentials than their iron complexes. Moreover, the Cu complexes where the ligand/metal ratio was 1:1 rather than 2:1 had significantly higher intracellular oxidative properties and antitumor efficacy. Interestingly, the 2:1 complex was shown to dissociate to give significant amounts of the 1:1 complex that could be the major cytotoxic effector. Both types of Cu complex showed significantly more antiproliferative activity than the ligand alone. We also demonstrate the importance of the inductive effects of substituents on the carbonyl group of the parent ketone, which influence the Cu(II/I) redox potentials because of their proximity to the metal center.

        "abstract": "Human kinesin Eg5, which plays an essential role in mitosis by establishing the bipolar spindle, has proven to be an interesting drug target for the development of cancer chemotherapeutics. Here, we report the crystal structures of the Eg5 motor domain complexed with enastron, dimethylenastron, and fluorastrol. By comparing these structures to that of monastrol and mon-97, we identified the main reasons for increased potency of these new inhibitors, namely the better fit of the ligand to the allosteric binding site and the addition of fluorine atoms. We also noticed preferential binding of the S-enantiomer of enastron and dimethylenastron to Eg5, while the R-enantiomer of fluorastrol binds preferentially to Eg5. In addition, we performed a multidrug resistance (MDR) study in cell lines overexpressing P-glycoprotein (Pgp). We showed that one of these inhibitors may have the potential to overcome susceptibility to this efflux pump and hence overcome common resistance associated with tubulin-targeting drugs.",

Here we present the design, synthesis, and optimization of a new series of inhibitors with a different A-B-C system that has been modified by the introduction of a range of novel hinge binders (A ring). The optimization of the hinge binding moiety has enabled the development of compounds with low nanomolar potencies in both BRAF inhibition and cellular assays. These compounds display optimal pharmacokinetic properties that warrant further in vivo investigations.",

Polyamines such as spermine, spermidine, and many synthetic congeners are described to constitute a novel class of CA inhibitors (CAIs), interacting with the different CA isozymes with efficiency from the low nanomolar to millimolar range. The main structure-activity relationship for these CAIs have been delineated: the length of the molecule, number of amine moieties, and their functionalization are the main parameters controlling activity. The X-ray crystal structure of the CA II-spermine adduct allowed understanding of the inhibition mechanism. Spermine anchors to the nonprotein zinc ligand through a network of hydrogen bonds. Its distal amine moiety makes hydrogen bonds with residues Thr200 and Pro201, which further stabilize the adduct. Spermine binds differently compared to sulfonamides, phenols, or coumarins, rendering possible to develop CAIs with a diverse inhibition mechanism, profile, and selectivity for various isoforms.",
